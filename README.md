# 🤗 Hugging Face NLP

Welcome to this repository!  
Explore how to leverage **Hugging Face NLP** to build **state-of-the-art Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications** efficiently and effectively. This project demonstrates multiple **real-world NLP workflows**, from sentiment analysis to dynamic category assignment, using **pre-trained transformer models and pipelines**.



## 🚀 What This Repository Covers

This repository provides **hands-on examples** and **clear explanations** of modern NLP techniques using Hugging Face tools.

### 🔹 Core NLP Tasks
- **Sentiment Analysis** – Understand emotions and opinions in text
- **Text Classification** – Categorize text into predefined or dynamic classes
- **Zero-Shot Classification** – Assign categories without task-specific training
- **Named Entity Recognition (NER)** – Extract key entities from text
- **Text Generation** – Generate human-like text using transformer models

### 🔹 Hugging Face Pipelines
- Using `pipeline()` for quick model deployment
- Exploring different transformer architectures
- Efficient inference with pre-trained models
